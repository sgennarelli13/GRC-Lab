# GRC Risk Management Simulation-Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The GRC Risk Management Simulation Lab is about identifying cyber-risks and the controls that can be used to mitigate them. The primary focus was to develop a risk register for a fictional healthcare organization, then identify NIST controls for each item. In addition, the Risk Managament plan was to be translated into a powerpoint presentation for upper management with the goal of corporate buy-in. This lab was designed to deepen understanding of risk assessment, and communication, through the use of real-world tools.
