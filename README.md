# GRC Risk Management Simulation-Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The GRC Risk Management Simulation Lab is about identifying cyber-risks and the controls that can be used to mitigate them. The primary focus was to develop a risk register for a fictional healthcare organization, then identify NIST controls for each item. In addition, the Risk Managament plan was to be translated into a powerpoint presentation for upper management with the goal of corporate buy-in. This lab was designed to deepen understanding of risk assessment, and communication, through the use of real-world tools.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Ability to create and utilize a risk register
- Experience identifying controls and mitigating risk
- Development of risk communication skills
- Further understanding of the NST Risk Management Framework

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

-*NST sp 800-53r5 Control Catalog* for identifying risk controls
-*NIST CSF t0 HIPPA Security Crosswalk* for identifying aditional risks and possible gaps in the risk management program
-*NIST SP800-53r5 Risk Assessment Procedures* for calculating residual risk

## Steps

1- Create a Risk Register and catalog all information necessary to assess each risk item.

2- Identify risk treatments for each item and their corresponding NIST Catalog controls.

3- Calculate residual risk and determine if they meet acceptable levels.
