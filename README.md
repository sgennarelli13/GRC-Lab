# GRC Rosk Management Simulation-Lab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The GRC Risk Management SimulationLab is about identifying cyber-risks and the controls that can be used to mitigate them. The primary focus was to develop a risk register and then identify NIST controls for each item. In addition, the Risk Managament plan was to be translated into a powerpoint presentation for upper management with the goal of corporate buy-in. This lab was designed to deepen understanding of risk assessment, and communication, through the use of real-world tools.

### Skills Learned

-*NST sp 800-53r5 Control Catalog* for identifying risk controls
-*NIST CSF t0 HIPPA Security Crosswalk* for identifying aditional risks and possible gaps in the risk management program
-*NIST SP800-53r5 

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
